# defense-article-analysis-hindi
This is a final year project which is a model(MultinomialNB) based UI designed in streamlit having scrapers for 4 hindi news agencies namely : indiatv, tv9, aajtaj, ndtv. 
The URL of the article from the required news agency can be entered and can run an analysis on the article which gives the polarity at sentence and hence the overall sentiment of the article
The UI uses graphs and world cloud to make the results of analysis more presentable.
It is an intelligent system as the dataset creation and annotations as well were done by the project group. Hence it was an end-to-end development project
The pickle files and trained vocabulary of the model have been added into the project folder.
the backed model and dataset used for training will be added as a seperate backend Repo.
